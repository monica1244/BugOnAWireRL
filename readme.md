### frames.py
Samples frames and displays them as is from a selected bounding box. Gets 4 fps around now.
Open the swf link from above and _restore_ firefox to small size and position at top left. May need resizing as per resolution/screen/environment.
Run frames.py and move the new window generated to the right.

### main.py
Currently a hardcoded agent that just plays with right, left and always jumps after a point.

### ocr_main.py
Different bounding boxes to get the score. Also does white filtering to get only the text as white on black background. Need to run OCR on this to convert to integer score.
